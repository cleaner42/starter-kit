This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
# and then
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## API

### Projects

The projects API is available as a Next.js Route Handler at `/api/projects`.

#### Endpoint

```
GET /api/projects
```

#### Response

Returns a JSON object containing a `data` property with a `projects` array:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "projects": []
  }
}
```

#### Usage

You can fetch the projects data from the API route in your Next.js components or pages using the `fetch` API or any HTTP client library. Check out the [Next.js documentation on API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/fetching-data) for more details on how to fetch data.
